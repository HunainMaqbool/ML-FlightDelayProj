## **Instructions to Run the Project**

### **1. Download the Project Files**  
- Download the ZIP file: **`ML-Proj-Dataset.zip`** from this repository.

---

### **2. Extract the ZIP File**  
- Locate the downloaded ZIP file on your system.  
- Use an archive manager (e.g., File Explorer on Windows, Finder on macOS, or any ZIP extraction tool) to extract its contents to a folder.

---

### **3. Locate the Project Notebook**  
- Navigate to the folder where the ZIP was extracted.  
- Open the file named **`project attempt.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or any compatible Python IDE (e.g., VS Code).

---

### **4. Update File Paths**  
- The notebook references specific file paths for the data.  
- Locate the variables or code sections where file paths are used and update them to match the directory structure on your system.

---

### **5. Run All Cells**  
- In Jupyter Notebook, use the **"Run All"** button in the toolbar to execute all cells sequentially.  
- Ensure all dependencies and libraries are installed for smooth execution.

---

### **6. View the Output**  
- Once the cells are executed, the notebook will process the data and generate results as per the implemented logic.  
- You can review visualizations, processed data, and outputs directly in the notebook.
